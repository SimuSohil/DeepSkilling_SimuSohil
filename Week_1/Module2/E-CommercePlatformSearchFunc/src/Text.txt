Big O Notation:
The big O notation is the way to describe how fast an algorithm is or how slow an algorithm is based on how much
data the algorithm processes.

Some common Big O Notations include:
1. O(1) - Constant Time (For looking at the first item in a list or an array)
2. O(n) - Linear Time (Look through all the items in an array for finding an element)
3. O(log n) - Logarithmic Time (search an item in a list/array by splitting it into halves)
4. O(n^2) - Quadratic Time (Nested loops where we compare each and every element with one another)
